Sometimes you need to be able to see what requests are hitting your webapp and how exactly, in these requests' most raw representation. Short of [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), you don't have a lot of options, assuming you also want to log POST requests and need an ability to tune what you're seeing easily in terms of formatting, etc. [Wirelog](https://github.com/DimYurich/wirelog) is now here to fill the void.

It is written using [ratpack](https://ratpack.io/), and, in spite of looking weird, it's actually pretty simple in its design. I'm using ratpack's callback infrastructure to distinguish between different HTTP verbs, and then assign certain processing to them. The main intended way to use wirelog would be to modify `logger.info(...)` according to your needs: highlight some headers, fully dump HTML forms, showcase parts of URLs and queries. More info on running it is available in [README](https://github.com/DimYurich/wirelog)

Please let me know if you find it useful or if you're missing any kind of functionality it might provide.
