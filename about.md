My name is Dmitry Terentyev, and I'm a Software [Shit Shark](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shit+shark&defid=1988454). Why a shit shark, you ask? Well, not all the people write new software. Some of us have to maintain existing (and rapidly growing) codebases. Oftentimes, these codebases aren't... ahem... even close to perfect. Yet, people have to support them. Also, general professional courtesy and self-respect begs not only for support, but for leaving things slightly cleaner than how you found  'em. That implies diving deep into this legacy codebase, and rewriting one piece of crappy code after another. This is exactly what a shit shark does.

What is this blog about? It's about responsible, reasonable, non-invasive ways of making legacy code vintage, so to say. It's about how you can take a legacy system with lots of unknown unknowns and rebuild it using modern technologies, while keeping it running in production under load and resting assured that nothing has gone wrong.

Why am I doing it? Because I can't "not do" it. Sometimes it's not easy, sometimes it's downright frustrating and disappointing, it sure takes a bunch of spare time since you can't just stop business features delivery for a month or two, but it's sure as hell rewarding after each and every step is completed. I figure this is my mission.

Given that Java is new COBOL (see [1](http://wiki.c2.com/?JavaIsTheNewCobol), [2](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2650254/application-development/java-is-becoming-the-new-cobol.html), and [3](https://www.influxdata.com/java-is-the-cobol-of-my-generation-and-go-is-its-successor-and-other-reflections-after-gophercon/)), there already is and goint to be a lot of badly-written Java software. Establishing, knowing, and using proper techniques and practices to support it, to enhance it, and to make it better is a big market with a big demand, and I'm going to use this blog to explore and document these techniques and practices.

Aside from work I also enjoy reading (mainly science fiction, fantasy, and psychology), cycling, swimming, running, listening to podcasts, maintaining my wine and port collections, and spending time with my wonderful girlfriend. She says I added this just because I made her proof-read it, but that's not true.

I'm originally from Saint-Petersburg, Russia, currently living in cultural capital of Silicon Valley -- Jack London Square, Oakland, CA.

Hope to see you here soon!
